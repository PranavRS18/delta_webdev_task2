        <p><h3>THE COLLAPSE OF CYBERIA:</h3><br>
            The collapsing City of <em>Cyberia</em> stands on the edge of total ruin. Once powered by the near-omniscient central AI system known as AUREX<strong>(Autonomous Unified Reconnaissance and Enforcement eXecutive)</strong>, Cyberia thrived in perfect machine-governed harmony. But now, AUREX is faltering. Core systems are failing, and rogue bots are turning against the few surviving humans.<br><br>

            Scattered across the endless remains of Cyberia, vital data keys, shard vaults, bot factories, and old military constructs still function — some erratically. As one of the last operatives sent by the Resistance, your mission is to stabilize outposts, harvest resources, and stay alive.<br><br>

            But beware — AUREX still watches from behind the veil, and its fractured mind may be both your enemy and your only chance at survival.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>CONTROLS:</h3><br>
            Use the following keys to move:<br>
            W – Move Up<br>
            A – Move Left<br>
            S – Move Down<br>
            D – Move Right<br>
            Q - Rotate Counter-Clockwise<br>
            E - Rotate Clockwise<br>

            <strong>TIP 1</strong>: Your aim follows your movement, but you can manually adjust it with Q and E for precision shots.<br>
            <strong>TIP 2</strong>: Your Bullets bounce off 5 times and lose speed gradually until they come to a stop. This is the point when you can reload that bullet.
        <br>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3><br>
            - Collect keys scattered across the terrain.<br>
            - Deposit them into <strong>Central Hubs</strong> to convert keys into shards.<br>
            - AUREX's Health is depleting over time, deliver shards to <strong>Base Stations</strong> to recover AUREX's health.<br>
            - Repeat and survive. The longer you last, the more you restore order — and uncover Cyberia’s secrets.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>SAFE ZONES:</h3><br>
            Safe Zones are your only sanctuary. Inside:<br>
            - You are immune to all damage.<br>
            - You can rest and plan.<br>
            - Press <strong>'M'</strong> to access the Marketplace.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>TYPES OF BLOCKS:</h3><br>
        - Central Hub : Orange
        - Base Stations - Blue
        - Bot Factories - Gray
        - Safe Zones - Yellow
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>MARKETPLACE:</h3><br>
            Press 'M' while in Safe Zones to spend shards on power-ups. These include:<br><br>

            <strong>Ultimate Tracker</strong><br>
            Reveals locations of Central Hubs and Base Stations for 30 seconds.<br><br>

            <strong>Large Health Pack</strong><br>
            Restores 20 Health instantly to the Player.<br><br>

            <strong>Key Magnet</strong><br>
            Automatically attracts nearby keys to you.<br><br>

            <strong>EMP Blast</strong><br>
            Emits a short-range pulse that disables nearby shooters and bots temporarily.<br><br>

            <strong>Increase Ammo Capacity</strong><br>
            Lets you store and fire more shots before needing to reload.<br><br>

            <strong>Upgrade Firearm</strong><br>
            Enhances your weapon’s damage.<br><br>

            <strong>Data Mine</strong><br>
            A passive resource generator that slowly produces shards over time.<br><br>

            <strong>Teleportation Pods</strong><br>
            Place two points to fast-travel between them instantly.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>WORLD FEATURES:</h3><br>
            - The world is infinite and ever-expanding.<br>
            - New threats, structures, and secrets are dynamically generated.<br>
            - Learn your surroundings, observe patterns, and adapt quickly.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>ENEMIES & HAZARDS:</h3><br>
            - <strong>Buildings</strong>: Static obstacles that block movement.<br>
            - <strong>Rotating Shooters</strong>: Deadly sentries that rotate and deal damage on contact.<br>
            - <strong>Bot Factories</strong>: Dangerous structures that constantly spawn bots. The rate increases over time.<br>
            Avoid them unless you’re ready to fight.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>POWER-UPS IN THE WORLD:</h3><br>
            - <strong>Health Packs</strong>: Instantly restore 10 HP.<br>
            - <strong>Invisibility Packs</strong>: Grant 10 seconds of invisibility, allowing you to pass bots and shooters undetected.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>STATS:</h3><br>
            Keep an eye on your vital stats at all times:<br>

            - <strong>Top Left</strong>:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;• System Health<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;• Key Count<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;• Shard Count<br><br>

            - <strong>Top Right</strong>:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;• Player Health<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;• Score<br><br>

            - <strong>Bottom Right</strong>:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;• Player Position — Current Grid coordinates.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>SURVIVAL TIPS:</h3><br>
            - Deposit keys regularly to reduce risk.<br>
            - Use Safe Zones wisely — rest, plan, and upgrade.<br>
            - Avoid tight corners near rotating shooters.<br>
            - Time your invisibility to escape or infiltrate.<br>
            - Spend shards intelligently; one power-up can change everything.<br>
            - Stay moving. Standing still invites death.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>SUMMARY:</h3><br>
            You are the last thread in the unraveling fabric of Cyberia. Collect. Upgrade. Survive. Resist the broken machines, master the systems, and uncover the fate of AUREX — and maybe, rewrite the future.
