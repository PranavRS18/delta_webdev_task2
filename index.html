        <p><h3>THE COLLAPSE OF CYBERIA:</h3><br>
            The collapsing megacity of <em>Cyberia</em> stands on the edge of total ruin. Once powered by the near-omniscient central AI system known as AUREX<strong>(Autonomous Unified Resource Extraction eXecutive)</strong>, Cyberia thrived in perfect machine-governed harmony. But now, AUREX is faltering. Core systems are failing, and rogue bots are turning against the few surviving humans.<br><br>

            Scattered across the endless remains of Cyberia, vital data keys, shard vaults, bot factories, and old military constructs still function — some erratically. As one of the last operatives sent by the Resistance, your mission is to stabilize outposts, harvest resources, and stay alive.<br><br>

            But beware — AUREX still watches from behind the veil, and its fractured mind may be both your enemy and your only chance at survival.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>CONTROLS:</h3><br>
            Use the following keys to move:<br>
            W – Move Up<br>

        <p><h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3><br>
            - Collect keys scattered across the terrain.<br>
            - Deposit them into <strong>Central Hubs</strong> to convert keys into shards.<br>
            - AUREX's Health is depleting over time, deliver shards to <strong>Base Stations</strong> to recover AUREX's health.<br>
            - Repeat and survive. The longer you last, the more you restore order — and uncover Cyberia’s secrets.
        </p>

            - Deposit keys regularly to reduce risk.<br>
            - Use Safe Zones wisely — rest, plan, and upgrade.<br>
            - Avoid tight corners near rotating shooters.<br>
            - Time your invisibility to escape or infiltrate.<br>
            - Spend shards intelligently; one power-up can change everything.<br>
            - Stay moving. Standing still invites death.
